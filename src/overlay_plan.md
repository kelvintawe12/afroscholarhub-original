# Overlay Management Plan

## Plan:
1. **Review Animation Logic**:
   - Ensure that the animations in `DashboardLayout`, `StatCard`, and `Settings` do not lead to overlapping elements. This may involve adjusting the timing or conditions under which animations are triggered.

2. **Manage Overlay States**:
   - Implement state management to control the visibility of overlays and animated components. This includes ensuring that only one overlay is visible at a time and that they are properly dismissed when not needed.

3. **Test Changes**:
   - After implementing the changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure that overlays are functioning as expected and that there are no visual conflicts.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to the overlay management and animation logic.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
